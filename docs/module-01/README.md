# Module 1: Infrastructure & Prerequisites

**Build your dev environment with Git, Docker, AWS, and Terraform**

## Quick Start

1. **Read the conceptual guides** in this folder
2. **Practice with labs** in [`../../module-01/`](../../module-01/)

```
Learn:  docs/module-01/         →  Theory and concepts
Do:     module-01/git/          →  Git for teams practice
        module-01/terraform/    →  Hands-on Terraform practice
        module-01/aws/          →  AWS service practice with LocalStack
```

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Use Git effectively for team collaboration
- Understand containerization concepts and Docker fundamentals
- Understand AWS core services for ML workloads
- Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Practice AWS services locally using LocalStack
